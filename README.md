EAT-N-SPLIT
Eat-n-Split is a React project that allows you to split bills among friends. You can add new friends, select a friend from the list, enter the total bill amount, and display the amount owed by the friend or yourself based on who pays the total bill. The project demonstrates concepts such as state management, events, form handling, and adding/updating elements in an array.
